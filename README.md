We seek to design a PCB with the following features:
- EMG circuit for muscle flex sensing with vibration motor for feedback system
- Two accelerometers for helping detect posture along with two vibration motors for the feedback system
- Micro-controller for computing the posture and muscle stress levels
- Wireless communication between the micro-controller and a device such as a computer or smartphone. 
- Powered through small and portable batteries(2 AA)
This will allow for the device to not only detect bad posture but with the addition of the muscle flex sensors, we can see where the stress is being placed even when in a good posture position. 

The new features is the ability to wireless communicate with a device and also the addition of another type of sensor (EMG for muscle flex) which will give us another parameter to measure the posture and stress of someone's back. Furthermore the entire kit will minimally obtrusive, the accelerometers will be mounted on a compression style shirt as a decent enough contact will be neededbetween the accelerometer and the back.The muscle flex sensors will be placed directly on the skin.
